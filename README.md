# Python_dashboard

### Using the Dash library, I was able to make two different dashboards within a python environment.
#### The first is an interactive dashboard, showing the average price of avacados as a time-series. The user can choose which city/region to look at!

#### The second is from a population dataset. Here, we see if there is a correlation between a country's GDP and its citizens' life expectancies

#### At the moment, the GDP dashboard is not as interactive as I would like, and the apps can only be run locally. In the future, I intend to use Heroku to deploy these apps.
